    <h4>How are the machine learning and filtering working?</h4>

    <p>To keep this simple, we collect information based on profanity words from what the child is searching and we store those online in our online database. Based on these ever-changing words of profanity we update the profanity algorithm. So as the more people search the better it gets.</p>

    <br>

    <p>The URL is sent to use, we parse out all the words, and check each word for is it classed as profanity and is its a verb. If it's either of them we update our database and use the new words we added to adjust the filtering algorithm.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Each URL is based on the following base formula.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A number of words on a page.</li>
        <li>The amount or profanity words</li>
        <li>Number of verbs.</li>

    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>Using this information, we will start to see a trend where adult sites will have a higher profanity over a number of words. This is a great indicator of what to block.</p>
