# About
Robin is light weight award winning web browser. It is designed for low-end machines and for teachers and parents to block websites and terms.We are pleased to have won Two All-Ireland Eircom Spider awards. So far it has been downloaded 40,000 times. The goal is to build a free light weight browser with a built in filtering system.

## Chrome Extension
On first install, the parent will be asked to signup or login to their account using email and password combination.
After this, the parent can easily see what the child is viewing in real time and set black and white listed sites and block other browsers from being opened.
The parent can see if the user (child) tried to access a high profanity site or a blacklisted website and can reset the color theme on the web browser back to the users (child) selection.
